/** NIKITA
 * This Vehicle Bookings Management Systems manages the booking of Vehicles
 * by Passengers.
 *
 * This program reads from 3 text files:
 * "vehicles.txt", "passengers.txt", and "next-id-store.txt"
 * You should be able to see them in the project pane.
 * You will create "bookings.txt" at a later stage, to store booking records.
 *
 * "next-id-store.txt" contains one number ("201"), which will be the
 * next auto-generated id to be used to when new vehicles, passengers, or
 * bookings are created.  The value in the file will be updated when new objects
 * are created - but not when objects are recreated from records in
 * the files - as they already have IDs.  Dont change it - it will be updated by
 * the IdGenerator class.
